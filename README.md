Raylink is an experimental **infrared-based mesh communication system**, created as a personal research and exploration project.  
It enables device-to-device communication over a **custom lightweight peering protocol**, transmitting data wirelessly through the air using **VCSELs (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers)** and **infrared diodes**.  
The goal of Raylink is to explore **low-cost, short-range optical networking** — a field that bridges optics, embedded systems, and distributed communication design.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Raylink is currently under active development and not yet publicly released.  
> If you have ideas, want to collaborate, or need access to specific components or documentation, feel free to reach out — I’m happy to share details or assist where possible.
